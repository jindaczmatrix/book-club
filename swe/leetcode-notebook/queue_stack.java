//First-in-first-out Data Structure
Report Issue


In a FIFO data structure, the first element added to the queue will be processed first.

As shown in the picture above, the queue is a typical FIFO data stucture. The insert operation is also called enqueue and the new element is always added at the end of the queue. The delete operation is called dequeue. You are only allowed to remove the first element.
