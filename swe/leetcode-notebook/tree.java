Pre-order Traversal
Pre-order traversal is to visit the root first. Then traverse the left subtree. Finally, traverse the right subtree. Here is an example:

Note: in the following animation, the highlighting in red indicates that we return from the visit of the node. The order of the visit is indicated on the array right below the binary tree.

//In-order Traversal
In-order traversal is to traverse the left subtree first. Then visit the root. Finally, traverse the right subtree.

Let's do in-order traversal together:

Typically, for binary search tree, we can retrieve all the data in sorted order using in-order traversal. We will mention that again in another card(Introduction to Data Structure - Binary Search Tree).

//Post-order Traversal
Post-order traversal is to traverse the left subtree first. Then traverse the right subtree. Finally, visit the root.

Here is an animation to help you understand post-order traversal:
